# Imhotep

All the files in this project were either close to or entirely written by me. The framework which was provided by TU Graz, like the interface or server, are not included in the project as I‘m not sure if I‘m allowed to publish it. It‘s for this reason that you won‘t be able to compile the project. Regardless, I can of course demonstrate the compilation in a potential interview.
